      The directive looks like a string: "use strict" or 'use strict'..
      When it is located at the top of a script, the whole script works the “modern” way.

      Modern JavaScript supports “classes” and “modules” – advanced language structures (we’ll surely get to them), that enable use strict automatically.
      So we don’t need to add the "use strict" directive, if we use them
